# Shot Ideas

## Dashboard w/ Odometer 
- Maybe as intro to the video...? it's like a table of content idk
- From driver seat, same composition
- at different places, inceases starting from TAS
- TBD 
	- FoV, how much background to include in the frame
	- a video or a photo at each place? how long?

## View towards the back w/ Rear door open

## Side window view
- With or without passengers? i kinda like the view on its own with window frame idk

## View from top of the van (op)
- if the drone can do object tracking well?
