# TODO
## Ella
- wooden floor, a bed frame with drawers under... pulling out milk crates tha doubed as bed legs isn't great. A pull out kitchen? Also a fan would be nice

- For timbers, I'm thinking of just using the old floors from house... so we only need to buy bolts and stuffs, which will make it cheaper
